### Passive Income Profits

An investment in EGO is an investment in the EGO community as a whole. Each buy transaction from a holder contributes to the growth of the EGO system. The following is an example of how the transactions will be used to provide capital.

* _An investor places a buy order of $1,000 USD in $EGO. Our team will proceed to reinvest a portion of the funds from the 15% transaction tax, with complete transparency, into a range of passive income node opportunities. Our Treasury will retain the profits that the NaaS investments accumulate. Thirty percent of the profits from passive income investments will be allocated to the LP in order to allow holders to sell their $EGO. Another 30% is distributed into buybacks as a way to raise the price if whales decide to exit and to reduce market volatility. The other 30% is used to provide the funds for passive income reinvestments. Lastly, ten percent goes to the developer wallet._

### Passive Income Investments

**Nodes** are our primary internal mechanism for investing in passive income. We will also look into various **high-yield farming** platforms as well. Initially we will begin by investing into four different passive income nodes across three networks. The following is an example of the investment process.

Strongblock nodes will be the first passive income we invest into on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Fire nodes will be bought on the Avalanche (AVAX) network whereas Atlas and Comb nodes will be purchased on the Fantom (FTM) network. As our holders increase, we will diversify our investment portfolio into nodes on other networks such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon (POLY). Our goal is to provide investors with a steady influx of income by utilizing the funds for consistent reinvestment into $EGO. Through passive income nodes, we are able to maintain a constant stream of profits into the project. We will allow community votes to determine the nodes we, as a company, invest into. During our voting process, the Dev team will present a few of the best options and will cast their vote. Then, the community will be allowed to vote for one if they do not agree with the Dev team's vote.&#x20;

### Staking and Community Privileges

Investors can earn up to 30% every month for staking 90 days, once staking goes live. We ensure this by initiating buybacks and adding LP from the profits every week. Instead of traditional banking where you earn 1% a year in interest, $EGO can provide you with up to 30% return on your initial investment monthly. Currently, there are 3 set time frames for staking. Seven days staked will yield a 2.5% return on your investment for that period. Staking for **30 days** will give you a **15% APR**. However, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive 30% of your staked amount once a month based on the initial locked amount. For example, if you stake $10,000 worth of $EGO tokens, a snapshot will be taken of the amount that was staked. That snapshot will be used to determine the percentage you receive based on the time period selected for staking. During the 7-day staking period with $10,000 locked, you will receive $250 in USDC at the end of the 7 days. If you choose to lock your tokens for 30 days, you will receive $1,500 in USDC. Lastly, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive $3,000 every 30 days which you can claim every month until the 90 day period ends. The total gains from $10,000 worth of tokens staked in a 90 day investment is $9,000 + your initial investment.

Our innovative smart contract can lower your sell tax permanently depending on the staking period you choose. For those who stake their $EGO tokens for 7 days, the sell tax will remain at 15%. On the other hand, those who choose the 30 day staking period will have their sell tax reduced to 13% permanently. Lastly, investors who select the 90 day staking period will have a 10% sell tax for all their transactions. According to Brewlabs, the cryptocurrency project that developed our contract, the $EGO token is the first to implement this inventive strategy for staking in their smart contract.

As a project that offers passive income to our investors, $EGO encourages holders to claim their rewards from staking. In order to encourage investors to do so and prevent sell pressure on our chart, we will be distributing staking rewards in USDC, or the stable coin for the Fantom Network. Through this model, we reduce the need for investors to sell $EGO tokens to claim their earnings. This creates a double-edged sword for those who earn staking rewards. The benefit of receiving a percentage of the amount staked vs. the tokens staked is that you are guaranteed either 2.5%, 15%, or 30% of your initial investment back. However, the disadvantage is that if $EGOâ€™s price increases during the staked period, the rewards will not reflect that price since they are in USDC. Nevertheless, the tokens that are staked will reflect the price of $EGO at the time they are returned.
