### Passive Income Profits

An investment in EGO is an investment in the EGO community as a whole. Each buy transaction from a holder contributes to the growth of the EGO system. The following is an example of how the transactions will be used to provide capital.

* _An investor places a buy order of $1,000 USD in $EGO. Our team will then reinvest this money from the 15% tax with complete transparency into a range of passive income node opportunities. Thirty percent of the profits from passive income investments will be allocated to the LP in order to allow holders to sell their $EGO. Another 30% is distributed into buybacks as a way to raise the price if whales decide to exit and to reduce market volatility. The last 30% is used to provide the funds for passive income reinvestments. 10% goes to the developer wallet development. Our Treasury backs these profit gains._

### Passive Income Investments

**Nodes** are our primary internal mechanism for investing in passive income. We will also look into various **high-yield farming** platforms as well. Initially we will begin by investing into four different passive income nodes across three networks. The following is an example of the investment process.

Strongblock nodes will be the first passive income we invest into on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Fire nodes will be bought on the Avalanche (AVAX) network whereas Atlas and Comb nodes will be purchased on the Fantom (FTM) network. As our holders increase, we will diversify our investment portfolio into nodes on other networks such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon (POLY). Our goal is to provide investors with a steady influx of income by utilizing the funds for consistent reinvestment into $EGO. Through passive income nodes, we are able to maintain a constant stream of profits into the project. Note, these are just examples of projects that are worth looking into. As a community, we will vote and decide together.

### Staking and Community Privileges

Once staking is live, investors can earn up to 30% every month for staking 90 days. We ensure this by initiating buybacks and adding LP from the profits every week. Instead of traditional banking where you earn 1% a year in interest, $EGO can provide you with up to 30% return on your investment monthly. Currently there are 3 set time frames for staking. Seven days staked will yield a 2.5% return on your investment during that time. Staking for 30 days will give you a 15% APR. However, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive your rewards once a month based on the initial locked amount. For example, if you stake 10,000 EGO for the 7 day investment period, you will receive 250 EGO. For the 30 day investment, you will receive 1500 EGO. On the 90 day investment, you will receive 3,000 EGO every 30 days which you can claim until the staking time is up. The total gains from 10,000 tokens staked in a 90 day investment is 9,000 tokens+your initial investment.
