### Staking and Community Privileges

Once staking is live, investors can earn up to 30% every month for staking 90 days. We ensure this by initiating buybacks and adding LP from the profits every week. Instead of traditional banking where you earn 1% a year in interest, with EGO, you can get up to 30% return on your investment monthly. Currently there are 3 time frames for staking. 7 days staked will yield a 2.5% return during that time. Staking for 30 days will give you a 15% APR. However, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive your rewards once a month based on the initial locked amount. For example, if you stake 10,000 EGO for the 7 day investment period, you will receive 250 EGO. For the 30 day investment, you will receive 1500 EGO. On the 90 day investment, you will receive 3,000 EGO every 30 days which you can claim until the staking time is up. The total gains from 10,000 tokens staked in a 90 day investment is 9,000 tokens+your initial investment.
