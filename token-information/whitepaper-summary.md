### $EGO Managed Trading System (EMTS)

During the beginning of our protocol, we intended on investing into other passive income protocols in order to generate a residual revenue stream for the project. This would've supplied the rewards for the staking pool as well as push the protocol forward through funding for other departments. However, as the market shifted and a majority of our passive income investments were no longer able to offer high rewards, the team at EGO adapted to the current market conditions.&#x20;

As different projects look to grow their treasury or create a passive income source for their own protocol, the team at EGO has created an opportunity for other projects to yield a minimum 20% return\* per month on their investment. The **EGO Managed Trading System**, or **EMTS**, are a collection of custom-built trading strategies hosted by the EGO team and created by our CTO. These strategies are deployed using Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange API services to automate trade management. Depending on the capital provided by the partner for the account, EGO will also receive a percentage of the profits that are generated by the trading bot. The percentage of the profits that are allocated to $EGO will provide the revenue for the staking pools and divided accordingly among the different sectors of the protocol. As the funds in the trading account continue to grow, the more self-sustaining $EGO will become.&#x20;

_\*Disclaimer: Previous results do not guarantee future bot's performance metrics. The EMTS produced 20-30% on average a month in a 6 month backtest. Forward testing results to follow as we generate live results._&#x20;

### Staking and Community Privileges

Investors can earn a variable percentage of their dollar-value staked (DVS) every two weeks with EGO staking. The model for the rewards distribution is designed to ensure an equal and sustainable percentage return to those with staked EGO tokens. The percentage of bio-weekly rewards is reliant upon the trading bot's performance. As a result, the percentage every two weeks will be variable. This is a double-edged sword in the sense that some pay periods will yield a higher percentage while others might not. Nevertheless, this model allows for fairness and sustainability for all the EGO community members, including the development team.&#x20;

As a project that offers passive income to our investors, $EGO encourages holders to claim their rewards from staking. In order to encourage investors to do so and prevent sell pressure on our chart, we will be distributing staking rewards in BUSD, or the stable coin for the BSC Network. Through this model, we reduce the need for investors to sell $EGO tokens to claim their earnings. This creates a double-edged sword for those who earn staking rewards. The benefit of receiving a percentage of the dollar value staked staked vs. the tokens staked is that you are guaranteed a varying percentage of your investment back every two weeks. However, the disadvantage is that if $EGO’s price increases during the staked period, the rewards will not reflect that price since they are in BUSD. However, the tokens that are staked will reflect the price of $EGO at the time they are returned.
