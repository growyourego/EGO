### Division of Transaction Tax

An investment in EGO is an investment in the EGO community as a whole. Each buy transaction from a holder contributes to the growth of the EGO system. The following is an example of how the transactions will be used to provide capital.

* _An investor places a buy order of $1,000 USD in $EGO. Our team will proceed to reinvest a portion of the funds from the 10% buy tax and 15% sell tax, with complete transparency, into a range of passive income node opportunities. Thirty percent of the profits from passive income investments will be allocated to the LP in order to allow holders to sell their $EGO. Another 30% is distributed into buybacks as a way to raise the price if whales decide to exit and to reduce market volatility. The other 30% is used to provide the funds for investments into the EMTS (discussed further below). Lastly, ten percent goes to the developer wallet._

### $EGO Managed Trading System (EMTS)

During the beginning of our protocol, we intended on investing into other passive income protocols in order to generate a residual revenue stream for the project. This would've supplied the rewards for the staking pool as well as push the protocol forward through funding for other departments. However, as the market shifted and a majority of our passive income investments were no longer able to offer high rewards, the team at EGO adapted to the current market conditions.&#x20;

As different projects look to grow their treasury or create a passive income source for their own protocol, the team at EGO has created an opportunity for other projects to yield a minimum 20% return\* per month on their investment. The **EGO Managed Trading System**, or **EMTS**, are a collection of custom-built trading strategies hosted by the EGO team and created by our CTO. These strategies are deployed using Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange API services to automate trade management. Depending on the capital provided by the partner for the account, EGO will also receive a percentage of the profits that are generated by the trading bot. The percentage of the profits that are allocated to $EGO will provide the revenue for the staking pools and divided accordingly among the different sectors of the protocol. As the funds in the trading account continue to grow, the more self-sustaining $EGO will become.&#x20;

_\*Disclaimer: Previous results do not guarantee future bot's performance metrics. The EMTS produced 20-30% on average a month in a 6 month backtest. Forward testing results to follow as we generate live results._&#x20;

### Staking and Community Privileges

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-03-02 at 11.51.44 PM.png>)

Investors can earn up to 30% every month for staking 90 days, once staking goes live. We ensure this by initiating buybacks and adding LP from the profits every week. Instead of traditional banking where you earn 1% a year in interest, $EGO can provide you with up to 30% return on your initial investment monthly. Currently, there are 3 set time frames for staking. Seven days staked will yield a 2.5% return on your investment for that period. Staking for **30 days** will give you a **15% APR**. However, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive 30% of your staked amount once a month based on the initial locked amount. For example, if you stake $10,000 worth of $EGO tokens, a snapshot will be taken of the amount that was staked. That snapshot will be used to determine the percentage you receive based on the time period selected for staking. During the 7-day staking period with $10,000 locked, you will receive $250 in BUSD at the end of the 7 days. If you choose to lock your tokens for 30 days, you will receive $1,500 in BUSD. Lastly, if you stake for 90 days, you will receive $3,000 every 30 days which you can claim every month until the 90 day period ends. The total gains from $10,000 worth of tokens staked in a 90 day investment is $9,000 + your initial investment.

As a project that offers passive income to our investors, $EGO encourages holders to claim their rewards from staking. In order to encourage investors to do so and prevent sell pressure on our chart, we will be distributing staking rewards in BUSD, or the stable coin for the BSC Network. Through this model, we reduce the need for investors to sell $EGO tokens to claim their earnings. This creates a double-edged sword for those who earn staking rewards. The benefit of receiving a percentage of the amount staked vs. the tokens staked is that you are guaranteed either 2.5%, 15%, or 30% of your initial investment back. However, the disadvantage is that if $EGOâ€™s price increases during the staked period, the rewards will not reflect that price since they are in BUSD. Nevertheless, the tokens that are staked will reflect the price of $EGO at the time they are returned.
