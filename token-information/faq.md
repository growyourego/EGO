### Is 30% APR sustainable?

* With the way our contract and tokenomics are written, 30% APR is in fact very sustainable.

Through these investments, we are able to create a steady stream of income from our diverse portfolio and reward our investors through reflections and staking.

### What happens if their are 3 consecutive sells from the same wallet?
