* **5% Buy tax**&#x20;
* **5% Sell tax**&#x20;
* **60 second cool down time will be in place between each sell transaction**
* **If there is a third transaction placed 65 seconds after the second sell, then that transaction will accrue an extra 20% tax until selling has ceased for 5 minutes.**

### Transaction Tax Breakdown

**100% of the transaction tax is allocated to the Investing Wallet.** The funds in the Investing Wallet will be used to invest into the EMTS Trading Bot. Due to the current market conditions, the EGO team allocates all of the taxes to sustaining the staking pool and reinvesting into the EMTS. The tax division as well as the profits allocation is yet to be determined within the next month.&#x20;
