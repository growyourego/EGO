**$EGO** will begin with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. On March 21st, we will initiate a fair launch with up to 7 fully-vetted seed investors. In other words, the seed investors will NOT have access to any of their tokens for one week after the launch. Additionally, these investors will be starting at a massive loss and only 5.5% of the total token supply will be distributed among all of them. The funds received from the seed investors will be injected into the liquidity pool pre-launch.

* 15% buy/sell tax for first 72 hrs
* Buy tax lowered to 10% after initial 72 hrs
* 60 second cool down time will be in place between each buy and sell transaction
* If there is a third transaction placed 65 seconds after the second sell, then that transaction will accrue an extra 20% tax until selling has ceased for 5 minutes.

**8% of the transaction tax is allocated to the Investing Wallet.** The funds in the Investing Wallet will be used to invest into passive income protocols such as nodes, high-yield farming protocols, and staking protocols. Additionally, the 8% will be divided as such:

* 5.2% to Investing in Naas & DaaS protocols
* 1.4% to Liquidity Pool (LP)
* 1.4% to Buy Backs

**3% of the transaction tax will go toward providing reflections to investors.** The funds from the tax will be divided evenly among all $EGO holders.&#x20;

**3% of the transaction tax will go into the Dev Wallet.** This will fund the Developers' salary as well as future marketing costs. The budget will be used to promote $EGO on various social media platforms.

**1% of the transaction tax will be dedicated to the Dream Foundation.** This contribution will go toward bettering the entire ecosystem through our marketing partnership and supporting their mission of fighting mental health issues. &#x20;
