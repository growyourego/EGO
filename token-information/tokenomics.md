**$EGO** will begin with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. Ten percent of the total supply (100,000,000 tokens) will be set aside for the current pre-sale model on **March 15**. In order to prevent dramatic spikes in prices, there will be:

* 15% buy/sell tax for first 72 hrs
* Buy tax lowered to 10% after initial 72 hrs
* 60 second cool down time will be in place between each buy and sell transaction
* If there is a third transaction placed 65 seconds after the second sell, then that transaction will accrue an extra 20% tax until selling has ceased for 5 minutes.

**8% of the transaction tax is allocated to the Investing Wallet.** The funds in the Investing Wallet will be used to invest into passive income protocols such as nodes, high-yield farming protocols, and staking protocols. Additionally, the 8% will be divided as such:

* 5.2% to Investing in Naas & DaaS protocols
* 1.4% to Liquidity Pool (LP)
* 1.4% to Buy Backs

**3% of the transaction tax will go toward providing reflections to investors.** The funds from the tax will be divided evenly among all $EGO holders.&#x20;

**3% of the transaction tax will go into the Dev Wallet.** This will fund the Developers' salary as well as future marketing costs. The budget will be used to promote $EGO on various social media platforms.

**1% of the transaction tax will be dedicated to the Dream Foundation.** This contribution will go toward bettering the entire ecosystem and supporting mental health charities through the Dream Foundation. &#x20;
