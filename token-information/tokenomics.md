**$EGO** will begin with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. Ten percent of the total supply (100,000,000 tokens) will be set aside for the current pre-sale model on **March 15**. In order to prevent dramatic spikes in prices, there will be:

* 15% buy/sell tax for first 72 hrs
* Buy tax lowered to 10% after initial 72 hrs
* 60 second cool down time will be in place between each buy and sell transaction
* If there are more than two consecutive transactions, an extra 10% tax will be added per transaction until 5 minutes have passed.
